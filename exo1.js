/*Exercise 1: */
const fruits = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];
/*Remove Banana from the array*/
fruits.shift(0, 1)

/*Sort the array in alphabetical order.*/
fruits.sort()


/*Add “Kiwi” to the end of the array.*/
fruits.push(Kiwi)

/*Remove “Apples” from the array. Don’t use the same method as in part 1.*/
fruits.splice

/*Sort the array in reverse order. (Not alphabetical... i.e. [‘a’, ‘c’, ‘b’] becomes [‘b’, ‘c’, ‘a’])*/
fruits.reverse()
